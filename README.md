# Data-Analysis-Seaborn

##  Project Overview
In this project, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python on two popular datasets: Tips and Titanic.  
The main goal of this project is to understand the data, check missing values, and find useful patterns using visualizations.

##  Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn

##  Tips Dataset – Work Done
- Loaded the dataset and explored its structure  
- Checked rows, columns and data types  
- Analyzed statistical summary  
- Studied tipping behaviour using visualizations  

### Key Findings
- Most customers visit during dinner time  
- Weekends (Saturday & Sunday) have the highest visits  
- Male customers appear more frequently than female  
- Majority of customers are non-smokers  
- Tips increase as total bill increases  
- Most dining groups contain 2–3 people

## 🚢 Titanic Dataset – Work Done
- Loaded dataset and checked missing values  
- Calculated missing value percentages  
- Identified columns needing cleaning  
- Created visualizations to study survival patterns  

### Key Findings
- Age and Deck columns had many missing values  
- Females had a higher survival rate than males  
- Most passengers travelled in 3rd class  
- Passengers travelling alone survived less  
- Majority of passengers were young adults

##  Skills Learned
- Data exploration and understanding  
- Missing value analysis  
- Data visualization using Seaborn  
- Finding insights from real datasets

## 🚀 Conclusion
This project helped me understand the complete EDA process, which is the first and most important step before building Machine Learning models.
